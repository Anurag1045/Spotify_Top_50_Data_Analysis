## Purpose :
<b>The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the dataset in place for top 50 Songs in Spotify. Per the initial data analysis, we may think of using appropriate machine learning algorithms to see patterns in the data if any.

Overall looking at the description of the data, it seems to be both a supervised as well as unsupervised learning problem, but we'll starting finding useful information first out of our data, post which we will focus on model building and its improvement.

The idea is to overall explore the data and find as much information as possible.
